# -Time-Series-Data-Analysis-Using-Python

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing time series data using Pandas and Matplotlib in Python. It includes key tasks like calculating statistics, slicing data by date, performing rolling-window analysis, and creating visualizations.

Key Features:
1. Mean Value Calculation: Calculated the mean of a 'Value' column for January 2023.
2. Data Extraction: Extracted and displayed data for a specific week (January 15-21, 2023).
3. Rolling 7-Day Average: Created a rolling average for the 'Value' column and added it to a new DataFrame.
4. Data Visualization: Plotted a line chart showing both the original 'Value' data and the 7-day rolling average for comparison.

Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas for time series manipulation.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
